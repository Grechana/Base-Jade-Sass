# Base-Jade-Sass

This is a basic workflow that uses Grunt to

+ watch for changes
+ compile Jade & Sass
+ produce a build from source
+ launch a static web server

In other words, its a good starting point for working on simple web projects.

## Getting started

+ Clone the repository to a local directory and edit `package.json` with a new project name.
+ Launch terminal in the new directory and install the dependancies: `$ npm install`.
+ Run grunt: `$ grunt`.
+ Edit the `/source` directory to your hearts content and view the output at `http://0.0.0.0:4000`.
